# Numerical Computation for Algebraic Problems

The course provides an introduction to numerical computation. Very
frequently, mathematical problems cannot be solved precisely, and an
approximate solution obtained by a series of calculations on a
computer is the best one can hope to find. In the course we will look
at a variety of mathematical problems and learn how to choose good
numerical methods for solving them, and how to analyze the error. The
main focus will be on linear systems of equations. We will also study
nonlinear equations in one variable, and nonlinear systems of
equations.
