## Lectures

The numbers before each topic typically correspond to the section numbers in the Ascher and Greif textbook. In some cases, however, topics covered in lecture do not precisely correspond to a section, and in those cases, the number is the book section most closely related.

| Lecture | Date     | Topic        | Notes | HW |
| -- | --------- | ------------ | ----- | -- |
