# Homework

Homework assignments for this course will be managed using
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) and a version of
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) hosted by the Department of
Computer Science.

You'll need an CS [undergraduate account](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/getacct/).

## Retrieve the assignment repo
- Login to the
  [local Bitbucket server](https://stash.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca:8443) using
  your **undergraduate** username and password.
- Clone the assignment repo onto the machine that you're going to use
  for your assignment. You may use your laptop or one of the departmental
  Linux servers via `ssh remote.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca`.
- Add your code and solutions to the repo.

## Submit the assignment

At the end of due date, the TAs will make local copies of your
repos. You can continue to make changes after that date, but TA will
only have the version that was collected on the due date. If you wish
the TA to consider updates made to the repo *after* the due date, send
email to `cpsc302@ugrad.cs.ubc.ca`, requesting that the revised
version be graded.

**Note: this request will incur a delay day.**

## Collaboration policy

All homeworks involve programming tasks. You may collaborate and
consult with other students in the course, but you must hand in your
own assignments and your own code. If you have collaborated or
consulted with someone while working on your assignment, you must
acknowledge this explicitly in your submitted assignment. If you are
unsure about any of these rules, feel free to consult with your
instructor or visit the departmental webpage on
[Collaboration and Plagiarism](https://my.cs.ubc.ca/docs/collaboration-plagiarism).
