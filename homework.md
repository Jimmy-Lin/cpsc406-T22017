# Homework

## Collaboration policy

All homeworks involve programming tasks. You may collaborate and
consult with other students in the course, but you must hand in your
own assignments and your own code. If you have collaborated or
consulted with someone while working on your assignment, you must
acknowledge this explicitly in your submitted assignment. If you are
unsure about any of these rules, feel free to consult with your
instructor or visit the departmental webpage on
[Collaboration and Plagiarism](https://my.cs.ubc.ca/docs/collaboration-plagiarism).

## Late submissions

Each student has a three business-day allowance to use throughout the
term. If an assignment is due by Thursday, then submission by Friday
counts as one delay; a submission by Monday counts as two delays; a
submission by Tuesday counts as three delays (and consumes the entire
three-day allowance).  Apart from using delays, late submissions are
not accepted. Once a solution set has been posted, no more late
submissions are permitted; consequently, you may not always be able to
use all of your delays.
